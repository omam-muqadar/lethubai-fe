## Features

### Speech to Text

Speech recognition is powered by OpenAI’s Whisper-1 model, which processes and converts spoken language into written text with high accuracy. The model uses deep learning techniques trained on a vast dataset of multilingual and multitask speech data. When a user speaks, the audio input is captured, processed, and transcribed into text in real-time, allowing for seamless voice-based interactions and command execution.

### Text to Speech

Text-to-speech functionality is handled by OpenAI’s tts-1 model, which generates human-like speech from text input. This model applies advanced neural speech synthesis techniques to create natural and expressive voice output. Once text is provided, tts-1 processes it, generates corresponding speech waveforms, and plays them back to the user, enabling smooth and interactive audio responses.

### Voice Interaction

Voice-based interaction is achieved through a combination of three key models:

- **Speech to Text (Whisper-1):** Captures and converts user speech into text.
- **GPT-4-Turbo:** Processes the transcribed text, understands the intent, and generates a relevant response.
- **Text to Speech (tts-1):** Converts the generated response back into speech for the user to hear.

This pipeline enables real-time voice conversations where users can ask questions, provide commands, or engage in dynamic interactions. The system listens, processes, and responds naturally, making it suitable for automated assistants, customer support, and interactive AI-driven tasks.
